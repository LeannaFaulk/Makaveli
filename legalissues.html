			<h4>
				1991
			</h4>

			<p>
				In October 1991, Shakur filed a $10-million civil suit against the Oakland Police Department, alleging that the police brutually beat him for jaywalking. Shakur recieved approximately $43,000 in settlement money, much of which went to pay his lawyer.
			</p>

			<h4>
				1992
			</h4>

			<p>
				Shakur was performing at an outdoor festival on August 22, 1992, in Marin City, when a confrontation occurred and Shakur drew a legally registred Colt Mustang, and allegedly dropped it. As it was picked up by a member of his entourage, a bulett was discharged - shooting and killing six-year-old, Qa'id Walker-Teal. No charges were filled against Shakur or the shooter because of a lack of witnesses. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Three years later, a wrongful death suit was brought against Shakur by the six-year-old's mother. The defense attorney acknowledged that the bullet that killed Qa'id was traced by authorities to a gun registered to Shakur. The suit was dropped when Shakur agreed to pay a $300,000-$500,000 settlement to the parents.
			</p>

			<h4>
				1993
			</h4>

			<p>
				On April 5, 1993, Shakur was charged with one count of felonious assault. He was accused of attemptig to hit rapper Chauncey Wynn from the group M.A.D with a baseball bat. Shakur pleaded guilty the following year to a misdemeanor in exchange of the dismissal of the felonious-assault charge. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 20 of which were suspended and ordered to perform 35 hours of community service. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In October 1993, in Atlanta, Shakur got into a scuffle with two off-duty cops (in possession of stolen guns) after Shakur "almost hit them" with his car. Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back or abdomen, according to varying news resources.Shakur was initially charged with the shooting but all charges were dropped against both parties.

			</p>
			<p>
				In November 1993 Shakur and others were charged with sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room. Shakur denied the charges. As a result of the trial, Shakur was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse, and acquitted of the weapons and sodomy charges. Shakur was sentenced to 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 years in prison.
		
			</p>

			<h4>
				1994
			</h4>

			<p>
				In early 1994, Shakur was found guilty of assaulting<font style='font-style:italic;'> Menace to Society</font> co-director Allen Hughes and served 15 days in jail
			</p>

			<p>
				On the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was robbed and shot five times by three men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan. In the day that followed, he entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation and found not guilty of six others, including sodomy, stemming from his 1993 arrest for sexual assault.

			</p>
			<p>
				Shakur stated that he believed the robbery to be a setup for the attack and accused Sean Combs, Jimmy Henchman, and Biggie of setting up the attack. Shakur began serving his prison sentence on sexual-assault charges at Clinto Correctional Facility on February 14, 1995. Shortle afterward, he released<font style='font-style:italic;'> Me Against the World</font> and became the first artist to have an album at number one on the Billboard 200 while serving a prison sentence.

			<h4>
				1995
			</h4>

			<p>
				In October 1995, Shakur's case was on appeal but because of his considerable legal fees, he could not riase the $1.4 million bail. After serving nine months of his sentence, Shakur was release from Clinton on October 12, 1995.
