				1987-93: Rise to Fame
			</h4>

			<p>
				Before using his first name as his rap name, Shakur went by the alias MC New York when starting his career in Baltimore. His professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's "Same Song." Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Undergroud in his track "I Get Around", which ranked #11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.
			</p>

			<p>
				In November 1991, Shakur released his debut studio solo album, 2Pacalypse Now.  Though the album did not generae any "Top Ten" hits, 2Pacalypse Now  is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel. 2Pacalypse Now  generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs "Trapped" and "Brenda's Got a Baby" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies.

				His second studio album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... , was released February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the Billboard 200.

The group released their only album  Thug Life: Volume 1  on Septemer 26, 1994, which went gold. As a result of criticism of gangsta rap at the time, the original version of the album was scrapped and re-recorded with many of the original songs being left out.
