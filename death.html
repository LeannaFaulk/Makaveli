			<h4>
				September 7, 1996
			</h4>

			<p>
				On Saturday, September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur was fatally shot in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was 25 years old. The shooting occurred at 11:15 p.m. (Pacific Time) when the car with Shakur stopped at a red light at East Flamingo Road and Koval Lane. Shakur was struck by four .40 caliber rounds fired from a Glock: two in the chest, one in the arm, and one in the thigh. He died from his wonds six days later from respiratory failure that led to cardiac arrest after the removal of his right lung in the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. 
			</p>

			<h4>
				Prior Events
			</h4>

			<p>
				Tupac Shakur attended the Bruce Sheldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associated spotted Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson, a Crips gang member from Compton, California, in the MGM Grand Lobby. Shakur attacked Anderson after hearing word that a group of Crips has robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a Foot Locker store. Knight and his followers assiste in assaulting Anderson.  
			</p>

			<p>
				After the brawl, Shakur went with Knight to Club 662, which Knight had rented for the evening. Shakur disclosed to fianc√©e Kidada Jones his involvement in the Anderson fight, previously having promised to return to her after entering the hotel where the fight had taken place and had her stay in a vehicle. Shakur left with Suge Knight after changing clothes.
			</p>

			<h4>
				The Shooting
			</h4>

			<p>
				At 11:10 p.m., while they were spotted at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the two women, and invited them to go to Club 662. 
			</p>

			<p>
				At 11:15 p.m., a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung.  

			</p>
			<p>
				Despite the vehicle having a flat tire and Knight's injuries, he was able to drive Shakur and himself a mile from the site, to Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Avenue. They were pulled over by the Bike Patrol, who alerted paramedics through radio. After arriving on the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and Shakur to the University Medical Center of Souther Nevada. 
		
			</p>

			<p>
				At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbituate-induced coma after repeatedly trying to get out of bed.  
		
			</p>

			<p>
				Knight was released from the hospital the day following the shooting on September 8, but did not speak until September 11. He told officers he had "heard something, but saw nothing" the night of the shooting. In an ABC Primetime Live interview, Knight told reporters that he didn't know who shot Tupac but if he did - he wouldn't tell the police.
		
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2014, a police officer who claimed he witnessed Shakur's last moments said Shakur refused to state who shot him. When the officer asked Tupac if he saw the person or person who shot him, Shakur responded by saying, "fuck you" to the officer as his last words. Paramedics, bodyguards and Suge Knight did not report hearing Tupac say those words, who were all present. 
		
			</p>

			<h4>
				Aftermath
			</h4>

			<p>
				Shakur's body was cremated on September 14. Some of his ashes were purportedly later mixed with marijuana and smoked by members of the Outlawz. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Before they died, The Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied any role in the murder. In support of their claims, Biggie's family produced computerized invoices suggesting that Biggie was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting.

			</p>
			<p>
				In 2011, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released documents revealing its invesitgation of the Jewish Defense League for making death threats against Shakur and other rappers.
