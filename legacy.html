			<h4>
				The Shakur Family Foundation
			</h4>


			<p>
				To preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to "provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents." The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The Foundation officially opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts (TASCA) in Stone Mountain, Georgia, on June 11, 2005.
			</p>


			<h4>
				Tupac in Higher Education
			</h4>

			<p>
				On April 17, 2003, Harvard University co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled "All Eye on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero". The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology. Many of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including State University of New York at Buffalo English professor Mark Anthony Neal who gave the talk "Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian" in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the "organic intellectual" expressing the concerns of a larger group.
			</p>

			<p>
				Professor of Communications Murray Forman, of Northeastern Universiy, spoke of the mythical status about Shakur's life and death. He addresses he symbolism and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled "Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)". I "From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero", Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban "bad-man" persona of the post-slavery period.  

			</p>
			<p>
				At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, race relations, politics and "hero/martyr". In late 1997, the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-led course entitled "History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur."
		
			</p>

			<h4>
				Documentaries and Feature Films
			</h4>

			<p>
				On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled Tupac: Resurrection was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2005 Academy Awards.  
			</p>

			<p>
				On April 15, 2012 a "hologram" of Shakur (technically a 2-D video projection) performed his songs "Hail Mary" and "2 Amerikaz Most Wanted" with Snoop Dogg at the Coachella Music Festival. The video footage was created by visual effects company Digital Domain. 
			</p>	

			<p>
				On December 24, 2015, Demetrius Shipp, Jr. was cast as Shakur in a biopic titled All Eyez on Me, which started filming in Atlanta in December 2015. Music video director Benny Boom helmed "All Eyez on Me", whci had been hamstrung by production problems. Multiple directors were involved with the film before Boom, including John Singleton and Antoine Fuqua. The film was released to negative reviews on June 16, 2017, which would have been Shakur's 46th birthday.
			</p>


			<h4>
				Wealth and Influence
			</h4>

			<p>
				According to Forbes, in 2008 Shakur's estate made $15 million. In 2002, they recognized him as a "Top-Earning Dead Celebrity", coming in at number ten on their list.  
			</p>

			<p>
				BET named 2Pac 'The Most Influential Rappers of All Time.' They then went on to say "his confounding mixture of ladies' man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like."
